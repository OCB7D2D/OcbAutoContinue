# OCB Auto Continue Mod - 7 Days to Die (V1.0 exp) Addon

This mod is mainly meant for fellow modders! It is pretty
much 90% copied from SphereII's SCore. It adds an additional
command line argument `-autostart` to load the last used
world directly when the game starts.

Additionally I've added an override switch when you hold down
`shift` during game loading to ignore the option. This may be
useful if you have a shortcut with the `-autostart` option
defined but still want to change an option from time to time.

Thanks to SphereII for the original code and idea!
